  <h1>Harry's World</h1>
  <h3>By J. K. Rowling (1998)</h3>

<p>It's best to be here early, especially on Saturdays. Peaceful then. The rising pitch of the kettle is whistle joined with
the faint hiss from the little blue camping stove. Twenty years old, that stove, found the receipt in a drawer just the other
day - a bargain at four pounds fifty - but it always pays to hang onto the receipts. The first cup of tea is the best, early on.
Little chance of any interruptions then. Steam rising from the teapot, fresh ... tell from the smell when it's ready. You can do that with tea.

Never quite the same, rest of the day, even at the end when they've all gone home - no, never quite the same somehow.

After tea, and of course, the paper, especially Saturdays ... the racing, you know - like to study the form. I never bet, no, not now ... when I was younger sometimes.

It's Saturday today. I mean it doesn't really make any difference to me, except for the racing it could be Monday. No, it doesn't really make any difference.

By eight-thirty the staff have all arrived, I can't hear them directly, but the soft, distant voices of the lifts rising and falling give them away.

Of course there is routine, that's OK, that measures time doesn't it? Even the period before Christmas and during the sales that follow, routine is still
there, although the time stretches and contracts as the public ebb and flow through the building like an unpredictable tide - routine will still be there,
disguised, beneath the surface, an undertow. As the management ritually pull out their hair, thicken their arteries, bark at their co-workers and re-prioritise
their priorities - behind it all routine will be waiting. Everyone here is a slave to it ... even if they move on, get married, die ... there will always be others
to master, to enslave. I too am a slave to routine ... but I don't mind. </p>
